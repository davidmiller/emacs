Mydotfiles
==========

Master branch contains portable dotfiels from the ~/ dir.

Emacs
-----

My .emacs is in fact increasingly just a set of (load-library "foo") however if you switch branches in this repository to the emacs branch, you get the contents of ~/emacs/ - which is where you can find all the fun stuff :)
